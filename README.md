# CUDA Operations 

This project compares performance between CPU and GPU with CUDA operations. Two simples cases are used:  matrix multiplication and 2d convolution.

## Features

- Matrix multiplication (CPU & GPU implementations)
- 2D Convolution (CPU & GPU implementations)
- Performance and error analysis

## Requirements
- NVIDIA CUDA should be installed

## Building the Project

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
